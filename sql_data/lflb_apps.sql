Young women leave their mothers and prepare to become mothers themselves.Similarly, we recall “The Twenties” as a transformative decade for women in particular. They voted, drove cars, accessed higher education and joined the workforce in increasing numbers, and sported new fashions that freed their figures from corsets. As we embark on a new set of “Twenties” – the 2020s – it is worth taking stock of what changes the century has – and hasn’t – wrought. Young women in both the 1920s and the 2020s could claim to be the best educated generations in U.S. history; to be entering a job market transformed by demographics and technology; to be embracing liberating trends in fashion and figure; and to feel both the prospects and the pressures of a widened scope of experience. Where we see the most change across the century is in some of the most formative parts of young women’s identities – in the roles gender, marriage and race play in their lives and aspirations. Though some barriers faced in the 1920s have been broken, there are new walls to scale – and women are still fighting some of the same fights.', '00a11090-49e7-11ea-bd99-97c1ba3fab5c-2500.jpeg', '5e3b23294d4fc82459705956,10,12,5e3c663c4d4fc82459705f30,11', '5e3b23294d4fc82459705956,5e3b23e04d4fc82459705970,5e3c3f284d4fc82459705d49,5e3c663c4d4fc82459705f30,5e3d83cc6b73eb0e7924f46c', '509 East Deerpath Road, Lake Forest, IL, USA', '42.2514491', '-87.8346993', '#524b4b', '#ff33e2'),

The National Park Service describes them as trees that were present during key events in history; in the United States they are especially linked with Civil War battlegrounds.The name Lake Forest reflects the importance of trees in our local history.  The natural beauty of the area was enhanced with extensive plantings by renowned landscape designers.  From dedicated efforts to contain Dutch Elm Disease and other blights, through three decades of recognition as a Tree City USA by the National Arbor Day Foundation, the City has never wavered in its commitment to the health and preservation of the community’s trees.As part of the celebration to honor the City’s 150th anniversary, we present our own Stately Observers, 11 trees visible to all on a walk, bike or drive.  These are but a few among the many arboreal observers of our past.  They are beautiful as representatives of their species, and significant as witnesses to important milestones in Lake Forest’s growth as an outstanding place to live.', '78d19320-61a9-11eb-b134-e9ee419a5aa6-2500.jpeg', '', '', '509 East Deerpath Road, Lake Forest, IL, USA', '42.2514491', '-87.8346993', '#246828', '#8adb87'),
